MAGIC mentee project 
Mentee: Sophia M
Date Summer 2019
The game is called “Simon”, and is based off the original Simon game. There will be four different buttons on the screen, and will be accessed using the arrow keys on the user’s keyboard. The buttons on the screen will light up in a random pattern, and the user has to repeat that pattern correctly. If the user is successful, the pattern will get longer and only end once the user makes a mistake. The goal of the game is for the user to complete the patterns correctly for as long as possible.
